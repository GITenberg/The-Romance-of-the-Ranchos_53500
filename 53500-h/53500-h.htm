<h2 id="c1">Ranchos of California</h2>
<p>Picture a map of California cut up into Ranchos like a crazy quilt,
dotted with twenty-one Missions and a handful of Pueblos. Picture a
people browned by the sun, happy, prosperous and carefree. Picture
a white-walled hacienda on each of the ranchos, every one open with
a never failing hospitality and welcome. That was California when
the Americans took it.</p>
<p>With the advent of American ownership the tide of population
turned to California in a never ending stream. By sail, steamboat,
covered wagon and finally by train came a new people. The great
Spanish ranchos soon passed to new owners and took on a new
character. There is a record of Spanish ranchos traded for nearly
every commodity and necessity. Ranchos like the Malibu and the
Centinela exchanged for wines and groceries, the Los Alamitos bought
with hides and tallow, the La Canada deeded for an attorney&rsquo;s fee,
ranchos for horses, for vines, for surveyor&rsquo;s fees and many ranchos
for mortgages.</p>
<p>It was a period of rare honor. Don Abel Stearns refused to take
advantage of a technicality in his favor and lost a 29,000 acre rancho.
Juan Matias Sanchez to help his friends, William Workman and
F. P. F. Temple, signed their mortgage to &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; Baldwin and lost
his own rancho in the San Gabriel Valley, wholly without consideration.</p>
<p>With progress and development the ranchos gave way to the
towns and farming communities. Many of these towns, now grown
to cities, were named for the ranchos on which they were built. In
Los Angeles County, Ranchos Santa Monica, San Fernando, Azusa,
La Canada, Puente and Tujunga all gave their names to the towns
founded within their borders. Santa Ana and La Habra in Orange
County likewise took their names from their ranchos. Santa Barbara
was an original Spanish Pueblo but still farther north in San Luis
Obispo County, Arroyo Grande, Pismo, Santa Margarita, Atascadero
and Paso Robles all correspond with the rancho of the same name.</p>
<p>Many names of roads and highways all over California can be
traced directly to the rancho over which they pass. Many others
were named for an illustrious owner, who perhaps in bright velvet
and astride a silver saddle, rode down the same road when California
was a land of great ranchos in the days of the Dons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h2 id="c2">Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit</h2>
<p>Among the ranchos of Los Angeles County Rancho Topanga
Malibu Sequit, more commonly known as the Malibu Ranch, is
outstanding. Not that it was the first of the grants, although in
fact it was one of the first, or because it was the largest, although its
acreage of 13,315 was exceeded by few, but the historic rancho has in
its almost intact state outlived all others and today it stands as &ldquo;The
Last of the Ranchos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Malibu was first granted in 1804 to Jose Bartolome Tapia
by Jose Joaquin de Arrillaga, Military Governor of the Californias,
acting for the King of Spain. It bordered the Pacific for miles and
extended back into the mountains,&mdash;a princely domain unexcelled for
beauty.</p>
<p>The heirs of Tapia held the property until January 24, 1848,
when they granted the great rancho to Leon Victor Prudhomme of
the Pueblo of Los Angeles for the sum of $400, $200 to be paid in
cash and $200 in groceries and wines. As the heirs were uncertain
as to the true name of the rancho they gave four names under which
it had been known and concluded by reciting that it was bounded on
the north by the high mountains, on the south by the Pacific Ocean,
on the east by the Rancho Santa Monica and on the west by the
mouth of the River of San Buenaventura. The recital that the rancho
was bounded on the south by the Pacific Ocean is correct as the
rancho faces the ocean more southerly than westerly.</p>
<p>Prudhomme also had a famous vineyard near Cucamonga and in
order to devote all of his time to the vineyard he sold the Rancho
Topanga Malibu in 1857 to Matthew Keller, known in Spanish days
as Don Mateo Keller, for $1400. Mateo Street in Los Angeles is
named for Mr. Keller.</p>
<p>In 1872 an agreement was entered into between Matthew Keller
and Mrs. Carrie S. Lewis for conveyance of the rancho to Mrs. Lewis
for $35,000, a little less than $3.00 an acre, but the buyer failed to
complete the deal and Matthew Keller remained the sole owner until
his death in 1881.</p>
<p>In 1892 in two conveyances H. W. Keller, son of Don Mateo
Keller and assignee of the other heirs, sold the property to May K.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Rindge and Frederick H. Rindge for approximately $10 per acre.
Mrs. Rindge is now President of the Marblehead Land Company,
owner of the property, and it is now being developed into a seaside
residential district.</p>
<p>From Tapia to Prudhomme, Prudhomme to Keller, Keller to
Rindge&mdash;surely a very brief history of a great rancho&mdash;yet today its
value is figured in tens of millions of dollars&mdash;surely a great advance
from the days when it was traded for the wines and groceries.</p>

<h2 id="c3">Ranchos Los Cerritos and Los Alamitos</h2>
<p>The lives of two persons seldom parallel themselves more
strangely than did the lives of two great California ranchos, the
Rancho Los Cerritos and the Rancho Los Alamitos. Both were part
of the Manuel Nieto grant made in 1784 by the King of Spain, each
was partitioned to a Nieto heir, each became the property of a New
Englander and each owner naturalized as a citizen of Mexico. They
rivaled each other for the honor of the finest sheep, the fattest cattle,
the fastest horses. Together they became the property of the Bixbys,
jointly they shared the growth of Long Beach and finally they divided
the honor of Signal Hill&mdash;Los Cerritos the northwesterly slopes, Los
Alamitos the southeasterly slopes.</p>
<p>Juan Temple was one of the New Englanders who early settled
in Los Angeles when California was a part of Mexico. At one time
Temple ran the mint for the government of Mexico. Later he opened
the first general merchandise store in Los Angeles, advanced the City
of Los Angeles funds for Ord&rsquo;s Survey, built the first theater, the
County&rsquo;s first Court House and the Temple Block, recently wrecked
to make way for Los Angeles&rsquo; new City Hall. Temple Street is
named for him.</p>
<p>Not only did Temple naturalize as a citizen of Mexico, but he
married a Spanish girl of a prominent family. Dona Rafaela Cota
became his bride and by this marriage Temple acquired one-twelfth
of the Rancho Los Cerritos, then owned by Rafaela and her eleven
brothers and sisters, heirs of Manuela Nieto de Cota. The remaining
eleven-twelfths was not so easily acquired and it cost Don Juan
&ldquo;$3025 in silver coin and an equal amount in merchandise at market
prices&rdquo; to complete his ownership of the 27,000 acre rancho.</p>
<p>In 1844 the large hacienda, yet standing on the Virginia Country
Club grounds, was built and occupied by the new owners. Until a
short time before his death Juan Temple divided his time between
his big Rancho and his many interests in the Pueblo of Los Angeles.
In 1866 he sold the hacienda, the cattle, the sheep, the horses and the
27,000 acres for $20,000 and removed to San Francisco where he
died. Benjamin and Thomas Flint and Llewellyn Bixby were the
fortunate purchasers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Meanwhile, adjoining Los Cerritos on the East, Rancho Los Alamitos
had had a similar career. Another heir of Manuel Nieto to
whom this 28,000 acre Rancho was partitioned, sold it in 1834 for
$500 to Brigadier-General Jose Figueroa for whom Figueroa Street
in Los Angeles is named, and at one time Governor of California
under Mexico.</p>
<p>In 1840 the Estate of Figueroa sold the Rancho, composed of &ldquo;six
sites of grown up cattle&rdquo; to Don Abel Stearns for $5500 to be paid
in hides and tallow to be laid down at San Pedro or at Mazatlan.
Don Abel Stearns was the other New Englander who became famous
as a Mexican citizen. Like Temple he, too, married into a Spanish
family and was equally prominent in affairs of the Pueblo of
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The same drought that caused a terrific loss of stock and forced
Juan Temple to sell Los Cerritos for $20,000 proved fatal to Don
Abel&rsquo;s ownership of the Los Alamitos and eight months after the
Flints and Bixby bought Los Cerritos the Sheriff sold Los Alamitos
to Michael Reese for $31,000, approximately $1.10 an acre. In 1881
the Estate of Michael Reese sold the rancho to John W. Bixby, who
in turn conveyed a one-third interest each to I. W. Hellman and
Jotham Bixby. Under the Bixbys both ranchos flourished.</p>
<p>When the Bixbys purchased Rancho Los Cerritos and later
Rancho Los Alamitos nothing was farther from their thoughts than
that they were purchasing the site of the future City of Long Beach
but they had the good judgment to hold their land and California,
oil and Iowa did the rest.</p>
<p>Four thousand acres of Los Cerritos were sold in 1880 by Jotham
Bixby Company to W. E. Willmore, who platted Willmore City, surrounded
by the American Colony Tract, composed of farm lots.
Tremendous effort was put forth by Mr. Willmore to make his city
successful. He advertised all over the country and even ran a special
excursion from Chicago with prospective Willmoreans. But the plan
was premature and not enough purchasers could be found to buy the
city lots at $25.00 to $100.00 each or the farm lots at $15.00 an acre
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
to enable Willmore to meet his agreement with the Bixbys and
several years later he abandoned the land to them.</p>
<p>But Willmore had planned well&mdash;his streets were wide, 80 and
100 feet being usual, and one, American Avenue, being 124 feet wide,
and the natural beauty of the land and ocean frontage made it attractive
to others. Soon a syndicate under the name of Long Beach Land
&amp; Water Company took up the sale of the lots and Willmore City
took the name of Long Beach.</p>
<p>Now the two families of the Bixbys, one from their hacienda, the
former home of Don Juan Temple on the Los Cerritos, the other
from their hacienda, the former home of Don Abel Stearns on the Los
Alamitos, watched Long Beach grow from a subdivision to a city.
The Alamitos Tract and the Townsite of Alamitos Bay were platted.</p>
<p>In 1897, William A. Clark, Montana Copper King and builder
of the San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad, purchased 8,139
acres of Rancho Los Cerritos for $405,000. This vast tract, known
as the Montana Ranch, has been held practically intact to the present
day. Early development, however, is planned for this property by
the Janss Investment Company, Los Angeles Realtors, who have
announced that they will build a model city on the ranch.</p>
<p>In 1921 the secret of Signal Hill was discovered and an added
impetus given the development of the two ranchos. Soon the hill
bristled with oil derricks. There being then many owners there soon
were many millionaires. Oil flowed so fast from the hill that on
several occasions it streamed uncontrolled over lawns and flowers on
the slopes of Signal Hill. Daily the value of the oil taken from the
hill equalled twice the price the Bixbys paid for both ranchos.</p>
<p>Slowly the oil fields have been extended&mdash;northwesterly toward
the hacienda of Don Juan Temple and southeasterly toward the
hacienda of Don Abel Stearns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c4">Rancho Aguaje de La Centinela</h2>
<p>Traded with two barrels of wine for a small adobe house in the
Pueblo of Los Angeles, then in turn owned by a noble Spaniard, an
ignoble Frenchman, a famous Confederate General and a Scotch Baronet,
then the scene of one of the most spectacular boom subdivisions
in the Land Boom of 1886-1888 and finally the site of a prosperous
and successful city&mdash;such is the history of the Rancho Centinela.</p>
<p>The rancho was granted in 1844 by the &ldquo;Department of California,&rdquo;
Government of Mexico, to Ignacio Machado by a grant which
described the land as &ldquo;half a league more or less of grazing land.&rdquo;
Machado did not prize his grazing land very highly and the following
year traded the property to Bruno Abila for a small adobe house
&ldquo;with vineyard fenced&rdquo; in the suburbs of the Pueblo of Los Angeles.
But in the eyes of these two traders, the small adobe was worth
more than the great Rancho Centinela and the deed provided that
in addition to the rancho Machado was to give as an added consideration
two barrels of aguardiente (wine).</p>
<p>Bruno Abila held the rancho until 1857 at which time he carelessly&mdash;or
desperately&mdash;borrowed $900 with interest at six per cent
per month, or seventy-two per cent per year, and, giving his rancho as
security, promptly lost it under the hammer. Hilliard P. Dorsey
bought the property at Sheriff&rsquo;s Sale for $2000, or about $1 an acre.</p>
<p>But Hilliard P. Dorsey paid too much for the land and two years
later Civility R. Dorsey, his widow, sold it out of his Estate for
$930, or thirty-five cents an acre. However, the deed to Francis
I. Carpenter, the purchaser, provided that he, Carpenter, was obligated
as part of the consideration to run off and dispossess of his own
effort one Fernando, a Frenchman and son-in-law of Bruno Abila, a
former owner, who had refused to surrender peaceable possession of
the rancho.</p>
<p>The next owner of the rancho was Joseph Lancaster Brent, a
Southerner by birth, but for many years a prominent citizen of Los
Angeles. In 1860, just before the Civil War started, Brent sold his
rancho and at the outbreak of the war hastened to make his way
south and join the Confederate Army. He was later made a Brigadier-General
and was with the last Confederate General to lay down his
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
sword. The conveyance by Brent was made for a consideration of
$3,000 to Sir Robert Burnett, a Baronet of Scotland, who on a visit
to California had fallen in love with the natural charm of the
Rancho Centinela and purchased both it and its neighbor, the Rancho
Sausal Redondo.</p>
<p>From this time on the value of the rancho grew rapidly and in
1885 Sir Robert Burnett and Lady Matilda Josephine Burnett, both
of Crathes Castle in the Kingdom of Great Britain, sold the two
ranchos for $140,000 to Daniel Freeman, the founder of Inglewood.</p>
<p>Then came the great Land Boom, the town of Inglewood was
platted and thrown on the market. Beautiful parks and plazas were
planned and dedicated and Mr. Freeman, with an insight into the
future that now seems uncanny, platted streets of unheard of width.</p>
<p>Used as cattle land by the Spanish, sheep land by the Baronet and
a Boom Subdivision by Daniel Freeman, the Rancho Centinela has
attained its greatest period of usefulness and success today as the site
of the thriving City of Inglewood.</p>

<h2 id="c5">Rancho San Pascual</h2>
<p>The Rancho San Pascual has always been a famous ranch. Its
owners have always been prominent in the affairs of California and in
the Pueblo of Los Angeles. It has always been famed for beauty and
today within its far-flung boundaries are the world famous cities of
Altadena, Pasadena, South Pasadena and parts of San Marino.</p>
<p>The rancho was granted in 1843 by the then Mexican Governor,
Manuel Micheltorena, to Manuel Garfias and comprised 13,693 acres
of land. Manuel Garfias later became Los Angeles County&rsquo;s first
Treasurer. At the time he was campaigning for the office of Treasurer
he sold a portion of his rancho for approximately $3.00 an acre
for funds with which to finance his ambitious plans.</p>
<p>Manuel Garfias was a member of one of the finest Spanish families
and married Luisa Abila, whose family owned the Abila hacienda
facing the Plaza in the Pueblo of Los Angeles and where Commodore
Stockton resided while stationed in Los Angeles. History records
that Manuel Garfias was an excellent County Treasurer but as a
ranchero he was very poor and bit by bit he sold off parts of the
rancho until in 1857, heavily involved in financial obligations, he sold
the remainder of the rancho to B. D. Wilson, the famous Don Benito.
Wilson Avenue in Pasadena, South Pasadena and Alhambra, Wilson
Lake and Mt. Wilson are all named for B. D. Wilson. Under his
care and under the guidance of Dr. John S. Griffin, who purchased an
undivided one-half interest from Mr. Wilson, the Rancho progressed
and the price of the land gradually increased.</p>
<p>The early conveyances of parts of the Rancho in addition to the
usual indefinite ties of an oak tree, a little rock set on a big one or a
pile of bones or brush, tied in one of its courses &ldquo;to a point on the
side of a hill North of the prickly pears.&rdquo; Many of the descriptions
tied to the walled garden of Benjamin D. Wilson, called &ldquo;Huerta de
Quati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later the Rancho was settled by the Indiana Colony, Pasadena
was founded, then South Pasadena and San Marino and today within
its boundaries are many thousands of magnificent homes, carrying on
the fame of the famous Rancho San Pascual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c6">Rancho Santa Gertrudes</h2>
<p>Seventeen thousand six hundred and two acres of California&rsquo;s
most fertile land, bordered by a large river, divided by two smaller
ones and with a billion dollar oil pool beneath&mdash;the Rancho Santa
Gertrudes sold under the hammer for $3.40 an acre.</p>
<p>The rancho was a part of the great Manuel Nieto grant made
by the King of Spain through the Spanish Governor, Pedro Fages.
The Nieto grant was divided among his heirs and Antonio Maria
Nieto received the part designated as the Rancho Santa Gertrudes and
in 1834 the Mexican Governor, Jose Figueroa, confirmed the title to
Dona Josefa Cota, widow of Antonio Maria Nieto.</p>
<p>Later the rancho was conveyed to Lemuel Carpenter, born a Missourian,
but for many years a resident of California when it was a
part of Mexico. For awhile Carpenter and his beautiful wife, Maria
de Los Angeles Dominguez de Carpenter, lived happily on the rancho.
They prospered under Mexico but failed under the United States
and on November 14, 1859, the rancho was sold by the Sheriff. One
week before the day of the sale Carpenter committed suicide.</p>
<p>John G. Downey and James P. McFarland, doing business as
Downey, McFarland &amp; Company, were the purchasers at the sale,
paying $60,000 for the entire rancho. Both of these men were famous
characters in California history. Downey became the Civil War
Governor of the State and McFarland a leading State Senator. Together
they opened the first drug store in Los Angeles, and Downey,
with Alvinza Hayward, organized the first bank.</p>
<p>In 1865 the rancho was leased for twenty-five years to the Los
Angeles Pioneer Oil Company for exploration and development of
oil. But, although the oil company diligently explored, no oil could
be found and the lease was finally abandoned.</p>
<p>The Town of Downey was started in 1873 with a boom and predictions
were freely given that the new city would soon outdistance
its sleepy neighbor, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Toward the east boundary of the rancho the Town of Fulton
Sulphur Springs and Health Resort was platted. But few lots were
sold until 1886 when the Santa Fe Railway built its line through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
town, bought up all the lots and replatted them into smaller ones,
planned a big hotel and renamed the town Santa Fe Springs. How
foolish the silver-tongued land auctioneers made the purchasers appear
when they bought lots, then at $200 apiece. How foolish would the
same auctioneers look today if they could see their town of Santa Fe
Springs&mdash;a city of derricks&mdash;a bonanza of &ldquo;Black Gold.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c7">Rancho San Antonio</h2>
<p>No horses so fast, no cattle so fine, no land so fertile, no rancho
more famous than the Rancho San Antonio. No family more prominent,
no hospitality more welcome or as freely partaken, no hacienda
more lovely, happy or prosperous than that of the Lugos.</p>
<p>Antonio Maria Lugo received the grant of the rancho from the
King of Spain in 1810 and for fifty years thereafter this old Spanish
Don and his sons were the sole owners of its 29,514 acres, adjoining
the original pueblo grant of the City of Los Angeles on the southeast.</p>
<p>The Lugos saw the rise of the Mission chain to the height of its
glory, then the passing of Spanish control and the rise of Mexico, the
breaking up of the Mission chain, the fall of Mexico and the coming
of the Stars and Stripes. Wars and governments came and passed
and the Lugo family stood them all and kept their rancho intact.
They built a wonderful adobe in the pueblo of Los Angeles facing
the Plaza directly opposite the church and there the social life of the
city centered.</p>
<p>But American ways and American prosperity they could not stand
and as the County grew, bit by bit they lost their vast rancho by sale,
foreclosure and litigation.</p>
<p>In 1865 the Sheriff sold the home place of Vicente Lugo, one of
the sons, for a consideration of less than $1.00 an acre. With the
conveyance went a large wooden house constructed by the younger
Lugo, one of the first wooden houses in the County. In 1883 Jonathan
S. Slauson, founder of Azusa and for whom Slauson Avenue is named,
purchased the land constituting what had been the home place for
$200 an acre. In 1910 the heirs of Slauson sold the land for $500
an acre.</p>
<p>In 1927 part of this land was sold for a consideration of $7,000
an acre for the site of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company&rsquo;s
plant. Only the cluster of trees now shows where the great wooden
house once stood while hundreds of workmen pass daily over the paths
and gardens of the noble Don Vicente.</p>
<p>On other parts of the rancho have been built Huntington Park,
Vernon, Walnut Park, South Gate and Lynwood, all prosperous
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
communities. The original adobe house of Antonio Maria Lugo is
yet standing on Baker Avenue opposite the Southern California
Edison Company&rsquo;s Power Station and near the Union Plant of the
Consolidated Steel Corporation.</p>
<p>The Lugos builded well and both the hacienda and the city home
on the plaza are still in good condition. Both should be landmarked
and properly preserved&mdash;testimony to the finest in life and honor in
the days of the Dons.</p>

<h2 id="c8">Rancho Los Felis</h2>
<p>North of the Pueblo of Los Angeles and adjoining the Los
Angeles River on the west is the Rancho Los Felis, 6,647 acres.</p>
<p>The rancho was granted in 1843 to Maria Ygnacia Verdugo but
it is evident that she had been occupying the land for some time previous
to that date as on February 17th, 1841, the City of Los Angeles,
by the President of its Common Council, granted to her the &ldquo;right
to use the water from the river of Our Lady of Angels for cultivating
the lands of Los Felis.&rdquo; At that time there was so much water in
the Los Angeles River in excess of what the pueblo inhabitants could
use that the city felt free to dispose of part of it in this manner.</p>
<p>In 1853 Dona Verdugo, signing by mark, granted to her daughters
parts of the rancho. These deeds recited that they were made
for &ldquo;the welfare and progress of my daughters.&rdquo; But the daughters
failed to progress and soon sold their respective parts for $1 per acre.</p>
<p>Antonio F. Coronel, famous pioneer of Los Angeles, purchased
the rancho and subsequently he deeded it to James Lick, equally
famous pioneer of San Francisco, by this &ldquo;more or less&rdquo; definite
description: &ldquo;Commencing at a point on Los Angeles River; thence
Southerly 3,150 varas, more or less; thence Westerly 6,200 varas,
more or less, to a napalera (prickly pear patch); thence Northerly
5,000 varas, more or less, to a calera (lime kiln) and thence Easterly
following along the right bank of the Los Angeles River to the place
of beginning 7,100 varas, more or less, containing more or less one
and a half square leagues of land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1882, 4,071 acres were purchased by Colonel Griffith Jenkins
Griffith and in 1884 Colonel Griffith sold back to the City of Los
Angeles for $25,000 the valuable water rights donated 43 years
previously.</p>
<p>In the western and southern parts of the rancho development followed
rapidly. The Lick Tract, now part of Hollywood, was platted,
then Ivanhoe and the Edendale district. But most of the mountain
and slope land of the Los Felis Rancho was undeveloped except by
hand of nature until 1898 when Colonel Griffith deeded 3,015 acres
of unsurpassed land to the City of Los Angeles, one of the finest gifts
ever presented to a city&mdash;Griffith Park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c9">Rancho San Pedro</h2>
<p>Within the boundaries of Rancho San Pedro was Nigger Slough,
Rattlesnake Island and the Salt Flats, and its own name was none
too beautiful. But the Rancho San Pedro overcame all such handicaps
and developed into a favorite child in the family of the Spanish
Ranchos.</p>
<p>This rancho, containing 43,119 acres, was one of the tremendously
big Spanish grants made by a Spanish King, who believed the limit
of population which Southern California could ever care for was
represented in the ten Missions, four Pueblos (San Diego, Los Angeles,
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo) and the comparatively
few Ranchos.</p>
<p>The grant was made to Juan Jose Dominguez of an illustrious
family quite different from the average Spanish family living in California
in its early days. The Dominguez heirs have each in succession
adapted themselves to every change and kept a large part of
their rancho intact to the present day. But much of the land was
so strategically located on the sea, around the harbor and on main
lines of boulevards and railroads between Los Angeles and San Pedro,
that it was inevitable that intensive development should take place on
these parts.</p>
<p>On December 22, 1854, the Dominguez heirs sold 2,400 acres at
the harbor to Phineas Banning, B. D. Wilson, John G. Downey and
associates for $20,000, or nearly $10.00 an acre, and on this and
adjoining land Banning founded the town of Wilmington, originally
called New San Pedro. During the Civil War Phineas Banning and
B. D. Wilson in a burst of patriotic enthusiasm donated a large
parcel of land in their new town to the United States government
for Drum Barracks, and as such it served a useful and vital purpose,
not only as a supply station and barracks, but, as well, to hold down
anti-Union sentiment. It was easy to donate the land but it took
eight years and a special act of Congress for Banning and Wilson to
get the land back after the close of the War.</p>
<p>Nine miles north of Wilmington but within the same rancho was
platted Comptonville, now Compton, originally planned as a temperance
colony. Ten miles westerly and also in the same rancho,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Redondo Reach, platted in 1889, became a famous pleasure resort.
Between these far distant points have been laid out the towns of
Gardena, Moneta, and Torrance. In addition to these there are
now many hundreds of small farms, and probably the world&rsquo;s largest
aggregation of oil tank farms, two or three airports, an excellent and
productive oil field, and there is plenty of land left in the rancho.</p>
<p>Such is the story of a gift from a King&mdash;a Rancho of success.</p>

<h2 id="c10">Rancho Santa Anita</h2>
<p>The Rancho Santa Anita, covered with oaks and on gentle,
sloping ground, was situated between Pasadena and Monrovia, and
includes within its 13,319 acres the cities of Sierra Madre and Arcadia.
Its title was founded on a grant to Hugo Reid made in 1841,
confirmed by Mexico in 1845 and by the United States in 1857.</p>
<p>For 20 cents an acre Hugo Reid conveyed the rancho to Henry
Dalton, an Englishman who had for 25 years lived in South America.
Subsequently it passed to William Wolfskill, whose home in the
Pueblo of Los Angeles stood on the present site of the Southern
Pacific station. Wolfskill left the rancho to his son, Lewis, and the
younger Wolfskill sold it in 1872 for $85,000 to H. Newmark &amp;
Co. Both Harris Newmark of that firm and Hugo Reid, the first
owner of the rancho, have perpetuated their names in history by
their writings of early Los Angeles. Mr. Newmark&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Sixty
Years in Southern California,&rdquo; has had a wide circulation.</p>
<p>Three years later for nearly three times the amount paid by
H. Newmark and Co. the rancho was purchased by E. J. Baldwin.
Lucky at the mines, lucky in the markets, lucky with horses and luckiest
of all with land,&mdash;no wonder they called him &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; Baldwin.</p>
<p>Baldwin at this time was a San Franciscan and had made millions
in the Ophir mines of Nevada. He built the &ldquo;fireproof&rdquo; Baldwin
Hotel, the largest in San Francisco, later destroyed by fire. But the
charm of Rancho Santa Anita soon took Baldwin from his northern
home and he moved into the large ranch house, devoting the balance
of his life to the development of this rancho and the acquiring of
others. Upon his death in 1909, his daughters, Anita M. Baldwin
and Clara Baldwin Stocker, succeeded him in the ownership of
Rancho Santa Anita.</p>
<p>Baldwin&rsquo;s greatest love was for horses and he developed a breed
of racing stock which became world-famous. Next to his love for
horses he loved trees and he bordered every road within his rancho
with trees and jealously fostered and guarded them. The towering
lines of Eucalyptus trees along Huntington Drive and Santa Anita
Avenue through the Rancho Santa Anita stand as evidence of the
hand of &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; Baldwin&mdash;those are his monuments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c11">Rancho La Brea</h2>
<p>For the inhabitants of the pueblo, later the City of Los Angeles,
the Rancho La Brea has always been one of the most useful of the
ranchos. The rancho derived its name from the La Brea Pits where
the brea, or crude oil, oozed to the surface to catch prehistoric
animals and preserve them for many thousands of years and to catch
a few stray cattle in the Spanish days, and also to furnish excellent
roofing for the adobes in the Pueblo of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The rancho was first granted January 6, 1828, by Jose Antonio
Carrillo, Alcalde of the Pueblo of Los Angeles, to Antonio Jose
Rocha, and comprised one square league of land. Early conveyances,
however, provided that the owners of the rancho, while they were to
have complete title, nevertheless were to allow the inhabitants of the
pueblo unmolested right to take such brea as they might need for
the roofs of their adobes.</p>
<p>Antonio Jose Rocha built an excellent adobe in the Pueblo of Los
Angeles as his pueblo home and this adobe, later known as the Rocha
House, was purchased in 1855 by the Board of Supervisors and the
City of Los Angeles and used jointly as the Jail, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office,
the Court House and the City Hall.</p>
<p>In 1860 the Rocha heirs sold the Rancho to John Hancock by a
deed which described the property as being a rancho &ldquo;some 4 or 8
miles West of the Pueblo of Los Angeles.&rdquo; Cornelius Cole, then
United States Senator from California, received 500 acres of land in
this rancho as an attorney fee for services rendered the Hancock
family and on these acres platted Colegrove, now a part of Hollywood.
However, much of the rancho was held intact by Mr. Hancock
and Major Henry Hancock, and later G. Allan Hancock, and for
many years the land with its springs, flowing streams and gentle
ravines provided excellent hunting ground for the people of the town
of Los Angeles. As late as 1892 there appears a conveyance, executed
by Mrs. Hancock, conveying 20 acres of land and reserving for
fifteen years the right to hunt for game. The subsequent platting of
the land following the completion of the Los Angeles-Pacific Interurban
lines soon ruined the land for hunting purposes.</p>

<p>For years the Hancock heirs took immense quantities of oil from
the productive oil field and, as the oil decreased, the development and
growth of the city changed the character of the land and the black
sump holes gave way to green lawns and the tall, ugly (but profitable)
derricks to fine homes, as the Wilshire District, one of the
world&rsquo;s finest residential sections, was built on the Rancho La Brea.</p>

<h2 id="c12">Rancho Cienega o&rsquo;Paso de La Tijera</h2>
<p>How differently the Spanish and the Americans viewed their
ranches is quite apparent from the names they gave them. The
Americans dubbed their ranches the &ldquo;Diamond Bar,&rdquo; the &ldquo;3 X,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;109,&rdquo; or some other rather picturesque but meaningless title.</p>
<p>The Spaniards blessed their ranchos by dedicating them to Santa
Anita, San Rafael, Santa Gertrudes, or San Geronimo. They saw
the many little streams of water flowing from the springs on what is
now Beverly Hills and named that Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas&mdash;the
gathering of the waters. They loved the big oaks of the district
along Ventura Boulevard between North Hollywood and Girard
and named it Rancho El Encino&mdash;the oaks. What the Americans
call the Baldwin Hills&mdash;they saw naturally formed a pass resembling
scissors and thus was named Rancho Cienega o&rsquo;Paso de La Tijera.</p>
<p>In 1843 Governor Manuel Micheltorena granted Rancho Cienega
o&rsquo;Paso de La Tijera to Vicente Sanchez, friend of the Mexican government,
valiant soldier and good citizen. But he did not live long
to enjoy his rancho and at about the time California became a state
his heirs partitioned his land holdings. Tomas A. Sanchez acquired
the rancho&mdash;his sisters taking property on Nigger Alley in the Pueblo
of Los Angeles as their share.</p>
<p>Tomas Sanchez also had a well deserved reputation for extraordinary
bravery and was Sheriff of Los Angeles County from 1860 to
1867, a period in which crime waves were permanent and the accepted
order of the day.</p>
<p>Gradually the Rancho increased in value. In 1875 Sanchez sold
a half interest for $60,000, later he sold a fourth and finally another
Sheriff sold the remainder. E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin became the
owner. Baldwin found this rancho something of a white elephant.
Sheep ranching became unprofitable and the land was not adapted to
orange groves and he knew nothing of the oil beneath it. But he
held the property and when he died in 1909 his estate listed Rancho
Cienega o&rsquo;Paso de La Tijera as one of its most valuable possessions.
The Baldwin heirs sold large parts of the rancho, and the Los Angeles
Investment Company subdivided tract after tract within its bounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Seemingly no matter how fast this old rancho has been subdivided
(and the growth of Angelus Mesa has been phenomenal) the remaining
unsubdivided part grows in value by leaps and bounds directly
contrary to its diminishing size. Like the estate of &ldquo;Lucky&rdquo; Baldwin
the estate of his daughter, Clara Baldwin Stocker, recently deceased,
lists as its most valued possession the remainder of the Rancho Cienega
o&rsquo;Paso de La Tijera.</p>

<h2 id="c13">Rancho Ex-Mission de San Fernando</h2>
<p>The remark is often heard, &ldquo;I knew the San Fernando Valley
when it was a wheat field.&rdquo; Thousands of Angelenos recall the
founding of Van Nuys and Owensmouth and the platting of Tract
1000, the largest subdivision in Los Angeles County. And even the
newcomers have seen almost unbelievable development. But what
of the valley before Tract 1000; what before the wheat?</p>
<p>When the Fathers of the Mission of San Fernando completed
their Mission and looked out through its arches their vision could not
include land not theirs. The grant to the Mission described 121,000
acres extending from mountains to mountains on all sides of the
valley, and named the rancho Mission de San Fernando, and as such
it prospered.</p>
<p>Spain encouraged and protected the Missions of California and
granted to them great tracts of land&mdash;Mexico plundered and destroyed
the Missions and seized their lands. Among these Mission
lands seized by the Mexican government was the prize of them all,
the Mission de San Fernando. For years chaos reigned at the
Mission. The government drove off many of the Indians, others left
and the herds of cattle became legitimate prey alike for &ldquo;Gentlemen
of Mexico&rdquo; and Mexican bandits not claiming the distinction.</p>
<p>In 1846 armed invasion of California was commenced by the
Americans. Governor Pio Pico in a blaze of oratory declared that at
any cost the &ldquo;Department of California&rdquo; must be retained as property
of Mexico forever and asked for authority to sell Rancho Mission de
San Fernando, then known as Rancho Ex-Mission, for funds with
which to equip an army. In this emergency the San Fernando Valley
was sold as a land bargain never again equaled, $14,000 for the entire
rancho&mdash;approximately eleven cents an acre. Eulogio de Celis purchased
the rancho at that figure and not only did he get a Mexican
land bargain but he at once stocked his big rancho and before the war
was over sold horses and cattle to both sides.</p>
<p>In 1854 General Andres Pico, brother of the Ex-Governor, purchased
a half interest in the rancho for $15,000 and in 1862 this
interest passed to Pio Pico himself. The land holdings of the last
Mexican Governor were equal to an empire. At one time he owned
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Rancho Paso de Bartolo, his interest in Rancho San Fernando, his
home place called Ranchito, near Whittier in this County, and
Ranchos Las Flores and Santa Margarita, both tremendous ranches
in San Diego County. In addition to his ranchos he owned a home
on the plaza in the Pueblo of Los Angeles and considerable additional
pueblo land in Los Angeles and San Diego. He built the celebrated
Pico House, yet standing, facing the plaza in Los Angeles. His life
was crowned with success at every turn. Under Mexico he was
California&rsquo;s leading citizen. Under the United States the ranchos he
owned and the honors he had held gave him a prestige accorded few
men.</p>
<p>For $2.00 an acre the Rancho Ex-Mission de San Fernando was
sold by Pico and the son of de Celis to Isaac Lankershim, Charles
Maclay, I. N. Van Nuys and B. F. Porter. Under the ownership of
these four men Rancho San Fernando became a great wheat field
and four great fortunes were made for its owners.</p>
<p>While Pio Pico, who once counted his acres in hundreds of thousands,
spent his last days in abject poverty&mdash;his ranchos, his city property,
his hotel and his home all sold for a mortgage&mdash;nothing was left&mdash;nothing
but his medals of honor and his memories of the past.</p>

<h2 id="c14">Rancho Tajauta</h2>
<p>Rancho Tajauta, sometimes called Rancho Los Cuervos, was like
a dwarf among giants. It could have fitted into one corner of its
neighbor, the Rancho San Pedro, or been lost in the San Fernando,
and yet it was no small plot of ground. It extended from what is
now Manchester Avenue on the north to the north boundary of the
Rancho San Pedro on the south and between Central Avenue on the
west and the Los Angeles River and Rancho San Antonio on the east.</p>
<p>At the height of the cattle days there was only one house on the
Rancho Tajauta, a two-room adobe. Today it is estimated over
20,000 people live within its boundaries, which include most of Watts
and adjoining area in the southerly part of Los Angeles&mdash;and a fourth
of the rancho is yet to be subdivided. The size of the rancho, however,
was no criterion to the number of its owners and changes in its
title. Before California became a state, its original owner, Anastacio
Abila, died and left so many heirs that it was necessary to divide the
estate into seventieth parts to properly partition it. These small
interests in the rancho were then traded in like second-hand Fords
are today.</p>
<p>Phineas Banning, passing the rancho in his stage-coach and eyeing
it carefully for bandits, noticed the soil was excellent, visioned the
railroads that would cross it and bought many small interests. O. W.
Childs, famous for the water ditch which he constructed and for
which he received most of downtown Los Angeles in payment, likewise
bought a few interests. So did Don Mateo Keller, who owned
the Rancho Malibu and Francis Mellus of Mellus Row. And
among the owners was the entire legal fraternity of that day&mdash;A. B.
Chapman, Andrew Glassell, A. Brunson and R. M. Widney, all
famous names in Southern California history. A $50 gold slug, the
common medium for exchange in those days when small change was
unknown, often bought an interest. Enrique Abila, one of the heirs
of Anastacio Abila, in addition to his own holdings, gradually acquired
many of the interests of the other heirs. He made his home on the
rancho and lived to see the city reach and surround him.</p>
<p>A little rancho was Rancho Tajauta, but a very active one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c15">Rancho Repetto</h2>
<p>Rancho Repetto, as such, was not an original Spanish or Mexican
rancho, yet in character and size it was just as a Spanish or Mexican
rancho would be. Its history, although covering a period much
shorter than the life of the Spanish grant, is full of the romance of
the ranchos of the Dons.</p>
<p>The rancho derived its name from Alessandro Repetto, later
known as Alexander Repetto, who purchased its five thousand acres
shortly after the Civil War. Some of the land had been found by
the United States Land Commission to belong to the Rancho San
Antonio and this Repetto purchased from the Lugos. Some of the
land he obtained from the government and forty acres came through
state patent.</p>
<p>Toward its west boundary ran a road recently widened and paved
by the County of Los Angeles. One of the deeds to Repetto refers
to this as &ldquo;the Road used by the horsemen coming from the rancho of
Juan Matias Sanchez&rdquo; (originally Mission land of San Gabriel).
Later the road was called Portesuelo de la Rosa de Castella, and still
later it was officially changed to Monterey Pass. It is commonly
called Coyote Pass.</p>
<p>In 1885 Alexander Repetto died leaving as his heir Antonio
Repetto, a brother who lived in Italy. The heir preferred Italy to
California and came here only long enough to collect his inheritance,
sell the rancho and return home. Harris Newmark, John D. Bicknell,
Kaspare Cohn, who founded the Union Bank &amp; Trust Co.,
Stephen M. White, once United States Senator from California, and
whose figure in bronze stands in front of the Los Angeles County
Court House, and I. W. Hellman purchased the rancho for $60,000&mdash;about
$12.00 an acre.</p>
<p>Out of the Harris Newmark and Kaspare Cohn holdings in
Rancho Repetto was platted Montebello, originally called the Town
of Newmark. I. W. Hellman, whose interest in the rancho equalled
1,500 acres, chose his land in the northwestern part of the rancho and
with that foresight which made him the foremost banker in Los
Angeles when he lived here and the foremost banker of San Francisco
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
when he removed there he held the land for the future. This
remainder of Rancho Repetto though closer to Broadway than Hollywood
has almost to this day remained just as it was when it was the
property of Alessandro Repetto, while to the south was a view of
intensive development, as Los Angeles industrially spread eastward,
and to the north was another view of intensive development as Pasadena
and Alhambra became cities.</p>
<p>Recently the last of Rancho Repetto has given up its aloofness.
Atlantic Boulevard has been cut through from north to south and
Beverly Boulevard is to cross it from west to east. The Hellman
heirs have conveyed a large part of it and the J. B. Ransom Corporation
has announced an immediate subdivision program. The final
chapter in the history of Rancho Repetto is being written.</p>

<h2 id="c16">Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica</h2>
<p>Most of the development on the ranchos of Southern California
has just happened&mdash;they, like Topsy, just grew. But not so the
Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica. A careful plan, expenditure of
great wealth and a determination of purpose unequaled all sought to
make a great seaport of Santa Monica&mdash;and no city could have grown
more contrary to the efforts to guide it than has Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The rancho was granted December 20th, 1839, by Governor Juan
B. Alvarado to Francisco Sepulveda, officer of the Mexican army,
and comprised 31,000 acres of mountain, mesa and ocean shore land.
In the following thirty-three years many changes came over California.
The rule of the United States supplanted the ruin of Mexico,
California became a state and Los Angeles a city. The wool of the
lazy sheep became more profitable than the hides of cattle.</p>
<p>In 1872 the heirs of Sepulveda, anxious to divide their inheritance
and believing that Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica had reached
the peak of its value, sold the same for less than $2.00 an acre to
Colonel Robert S. Baker, prominent wool grower of Kern County.
Colonel Baker stocked the rancho with herds of sheep and shortly
thereafter sold an undivided three-fourths interest in his property to
Senator John P. Jones of Nevada. Jones and Baker then conceived
the plan of a great harbor at Santa Monica and a harbor city on the
rancho; the fortunes of both these men were thrown into the project
and Santa Monica was platted.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles &amp; Independence Railroad with its terminus at
the new city and running to Los Angeles was built and operated. It
had been planned to extend the railroad into the mining district of
Inyo County and part of its name was derived from Independence,
the county seat of Inyo County. However, the line was never built
beyond Los Angeles. In connection with the railroad a large warehouse
was built in Los Angeles, and a long wharf at Santa Monica.
Every preparation was made for giant ships of the sea&mdash;ships which
were never to come.</p>
<p>In 1886 the land boom which descended on Los Angeles and
vicinity found Santa Monica well prepared to receive it. Colonel
Baker and Senator Jones had hundreds of unsold lots and those previously
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
sold when the harbor city was budding were ready for resale.
The Arcadia Hotel, a handsome tourist resort located on the bluff,
was built by Colonel Baker and named for his wife, Arcadia Bandini
de Baker, who formerly had been Mrs. Abel Stearns. Mrs. de Baker,
child of an illustrious Spanish family, was famed for her beauty, and,
as wife of Don Abel Stearns, commanded an outstanding social position
in Los Angeles. Upon Don Abel&rsquo;s death she inherited all of his
ranchos. Shortly after the boom the Estate of Colonel Baker, Senator
Jones and the Santa Monica Land &amp; Water Company conveyed 300
acres of land along the east boundary of the rancho to the United
States and on this and adjoining land the Soldiers&rsquo; Home was built.</p>
<p>Then another effort was made to create a harbor at Santa Monica&mdash;this
time led by Collis P. Huntington with the wealth of the
Southern Pacific Railroad behind him. This last great attempt was
given up only when threshed out on the floor of the United States
Senate and the United States had decided that the Harbor should be
at San Pedro. Perhaps it was the guiding hand of destiny that kept
Santa Monica unspoiled as a residence city.</p>

<h2 id="c17">Rancho Los Palos Verdes</h2>
<p>Rancho Los Palos Verdes has been the scene of some of the earliest
as well as the latest development in Los Angeles County. For more
than thirty years before Willmore platted Willmore City, later called
Long Beach, and before Jones and Baker laid out their harbor city
of Santa Monica there had been a thriving settlement at the port of
San Pedro in the Rancho Los Palos Verdes.</p>
<p>The town of San Pedro, later city of San Pedro, and now part
of the city of Los Angeles, was built around that port settlement and
almost the entire district was carved not out of the Rancho San Pedro,
as is generally understood, but out of the Rancho Los Palos Verdes.</p>
<p>The rancho was granted June 3rd, 1846, by Governor Pio Pico
to Jose Loreto Sepulveda and Juan Sepulveda, brothers, this grant
being a ratification of a previous one made in 1827. It extended from
Redondo to Wilmington and bounded on the north and northeast by
Rancho San Pedro and on the southeast, south and west by the Pacific
Ocean, comprising 31,629 acres. Pico, however, reserved a plat of
land along the beach, 500 varas square, for the use of the &ldquo;Superior
Government of the Mexican Nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the death of the original grantees and the passing of the
ranch title to their many heirs, Rancho Los Palos Verdes passed into
a period of extensive litigation and had it not been of such tremendous
size and of such constantly increasing value in all probability
it would soon have belonged to the attorneys. From 1865 to 1880,
seventy-eight lawsuits were instituted involving the rancho. The
ranch title itself was not confirmed until 1880. All of the heirs and
their successors in interest held undivided parts of the rancho and six
partition suits were filed before the property was divided according to
the respective ownerships. There were also a dozen suits to eject
squatters, several divorces among the owners, three condemnation
suits by the United States government for land for the lighthouse at
Point Firmin, an action to fix the boundaries of Timms Landing at
the port, two foreclosure actions and several complaints for possession.</p>
<p>The commissioners in one of the partition suits platted the town
of San Pedro, composed of ninety-eight blocks and this plat filled the
two-fold purpose of making an easy method of dividing the property
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
among the partitioners and of providing for the growth of the settlement
at the harbor.</p>
<p>In the years that followed the east part of the rancho progressed
rapidly while thousands of acres in the hills from Point Firmin to
Redondo were retained in a few ownerships and the land used only
for farming. Few people ever saw the rugged coast of Palos Verdes,
although Malaga Cove, Rocky Point, Point Vicente, Long Point,
Portuguese Point and Portuguese Bend were all known to fishermen.</p>
<p>In 1913 for a consideration of nearly $2,000,000 the western part
of the rancho was conveyed to Jay Lawler and Frank A. Vanderlip,
then of New York. Palos Verdes Estates was conceived in 1922 to
develop this part of the property and to make a world-famous community
of homes. The rancho of the Sepulvedas is a perfect setting
for this effort.</p>

<h2 id="c18">Mission San Gabriel Arcangel</h2>
<p>In all California no land has been the scene of such triumphs and
defeats, such prosperity and poverty, such alternating fair fortune and
dire misfortune as the lands of the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel.</p>
<p>The Mission San Gabriel was founded September 4th, 1771, by
Father Junipero Serra and land set apart for the Mission included
nearly the entire San Gabriel Valley. There was the usual struggle
to establish the Mission and convert the Indians. The first Mission
buildings were destroyed and the old mill&mdash;yet standing&mdash;built at a
great expenditure of toil and thought was a total failure. But within
a few short years after the founding Mission San Gabriel took its
place as the Queen of the Missions and the most prosperous of all.</p>
<p>The title of the Mission Fathers to the lands had not been confirmed
by written grant from Carlos III, King of Spain, and the governors
of California under Mexico took advantage of this to grant
ranchos within the valley borders. In the northwest part Rancho
San Pascual was granted to become the princely estate of Don Manuel
Garfias and later the sites of Pasadena and South Pasadena. Farther
east Rancho Santa Anita was created and eventually became the
property of E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin. Beyond that rancho were
Ranchos San Francisquito and La Puente. Along the south hills of
the valley Ranchos La Merced, Potrero Grande and Potrero Chico
were granted. By the severing of such large tracts of land the property
of the Mission San Gabriel diminished from tens of thousands of
acres to thousands of acres and then to hundreds.</p>
<p>In 1846 Governor Pico asked permission of his government to
lease the remaining land of the Mission San Gabriel &ldquo;to prevent the
total ruin of the Mission.&rdquo; No lessee could be found to take the land
under this act and on June 18th, 1846, Pio Pico made the final grant
of all the remaining Mission lands to Julian Workman and Hugo
Reid. The United States government, however, refused to confirm
this last minute disposal of the Mission land and declared the property
public land of the United States, first setting aside to Bishop Alemany
190 acres surrounding the Mission buildings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The public land was quickly taken up by many settlers, who were
eager to acquire homesteads in a country almost exclusively made up
of giant ranchos. Subsequently B. D. Wilson and J. De Barth Shorb
acquired much of this land and platted the present prosperous and
beautiful city of Alhambra. San Gabriel and Monterey Park also
have been built on land originally within the Mission boundaries.</p>
<p>The 190 acres set aside for the Mission Church was the largest
parcel of land received by any one Mission out of the land it had
formerly held. At the height of the Mission glory in all a million
and a half acres were under the control of the Padres. When California
became the property of the United States twenty missions other
than San Gabriel held from four to seventy-six acres each&mdash;a total for
all the chain of less than 800 acres. Eight hundred acres out of the
original million and a half.</p>

<h2 id="c19">Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres</h2>
<p>Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres was not in South America, as
its name might indicate, but was an important rancho of Southern
California. The rancho was granted by Manuel Micheltorena, Governor
of the Californias, February 24, 1843, to Maximo Alanis and
comprised 4,438 acres. Don Alanis died shortly after he received the
grant and his heirs conveyed the rancho to Dr. Wilson W. Jones and
Wm. T. B. Sanford, the former, one of Los Angeles&rsquo; first doctors
and the latter, an early Los Angeles postmaster.</p>
<p>But the doctor knew little about ranching and in 1852 he was
glad to sell his half interest in the rancho to Don Benito Wilson for
$662.75, or at the rate of 35 cents an acre. Don Benito&rsquo;s interests
were extensive and widely separated. Jointly with Dr. Griffin he
operated Rancho San Pascual northeast of the Pueblo of Los Angeles.
Jointly with Phineas Banning he founded and developed the city of
Wilmington at the port of San Pedro, and west of the pueblo, halfway
to the ocean, with Sanford, the Postmaster, he raised cattle on
Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres. Between supervising trips to his
ranchos and to the harbor he found time to maintain a home in the
Pueblo of Los Angeles&mdash;so large that after he moved it was used for
an orphan asylum&mdash;buy much city property, ship wine to San Francisco
and foster the development of the orange.</p>
<p>In 1858 B. D. Wilson bought the interest of Sanford in this and
other property for $16,000 and subsequently sold the rancho. In
1884 John Wolfskill of the prominent family of that name purchased
the rancho for $40,000. The purchase by Wolfskill was very timely
as the completion of the Santa Fe Railroad two years later sent land
prices skyrocketing and in 1887 he entered into an agreement to dispose
of the rancho for $438,700, or more than ten times what he had
paid for the land in 1884.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles and Santa Monica Land and Water Company
was organized to take over the land at that figure. This company
built a railroad through the property and platted the town of Sunset.
But few lots were sold, however, and in 1891 the Los Angeles and
Santa Monica Land and Water Company quitclaimed the land back
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
to Wolfskill and the townsite was restored to acreage. Then for many
years the rancho was used only for farming, although its neighbor on
the east, the Rancho Rodeo de Las Aguas, was subdivided into Beverly
Hills, and on the west Santa Monica grew into a thriving city.</p>
<p>In 1919 Arthur Letts, Sr., Merchant Prince of Los Angeles,
founder of the Broadway Department Store, bought the rancho for
an investment. Since that time Westwood, Holmby Hills (named
after Holmby, England, Mr. Letts&rsquo; birthplace) and Westwood Village
have all been platted on parts of the rancho. The moving-picture
industry has expanded into the property and several of the largest
studios are located there. Now the University of California at Los
Angeles is being built on the rancho, and already opened as one of
the greatest institutions of learning.</p>
<p>B. D. Wilson, John Wolfskill and Arthur Letts all profited by
their farsightedness, but none had the vision and none could foresee
Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres as it is today.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><i>CONCLUSION</i></h2>
<p>The priceless, romantic history of early California is everywhere
being more and more appreciated. It evidences itself in the names of
our cities, in our landmarks which are at last being preserved and even
in our architecture.</p>

this glorious chapter in California history the writer will feel the

this great plant which is not surpassed by any in the nation.</p>
<p>Great as has been the cost and the amount of labor expended&mdash;this
title plant is not finished&mdash;it never will be finished.</p>
<p>Each business day of the year 1500 to 2000 documents affecting
Los Angeles County real estate titles are filed in the Recorder&rsquo;s office
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
and by 11:30 p.m.&mdash;on the day of filing&mdash;all have been &ldquo;posted&rdquo; on
the Company&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>Much of the &ldquo;posting,&rdquo; much of the map making in the title plant
has no connection with present orders. Some of the work done today
may be used tomorrow, some of it may not be used for many years.
An important part of the personnel in this great business machine,
which we call the title plant, is engaged solely in the preparation for
future work.</p>
<p>But when the call comes, the plant is ready.</p>
<p class="tb">This plant was created to give the people of Los Angeles County
accurate service in the searching and insuring of titles. It serves
owner&mdash;buyer&mdash;lender&mdash;borrower.</p>
<p>From this plant, the Company issues policies of title insurance
protecting the ownership of real property. Step by step, these policies,
through a series of improvements extending throughout the entire
history of the Company, have been developed into the highest type
of title protection offered anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="c22">ESCROWS</h3>
<p>The modern escrow system was originated by this Company. It
was designed to make real estate transactions convenient and safe.
A highly trained personnel and complete and convenient facilities
provide efficient service to buyer and to seller.</p>
<h3 id="c23">TRUSTS</h3>
<p>The Company acts as executor and trustee under wills, as administrator
of estates, and in all other trust capacities.</p>
<p>It offers at a nominal cost an &ldquo;all-inclusive&rdquo; declaration of trust,
which is exceedingly flexible. Life insurance policies may be placed
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
in this trust, thereby protecting the beneficiary from loss, and to this
trust from time to time there may be added real or personal property.</p>
<p>The Company has had long experience in the management of
estates. If you name the Company as executor under your will, you
will be assured that your beneficiaries will receive considerate and
courteous attention and that your trust estate will be wisely managed
and profitably invested.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
